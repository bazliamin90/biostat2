		<a id="why"></a>
		<li><a class="c1">Comparing</a> mortality and morbidity rates in two or more populations is important for the evaluation of community health status.
		
		<li><a id="type"></a>Comparison is made by using two methods of standardization: 
			<ol class="ol2">
			<li><a class="c2">direct.</a>
			<li><a class="c2">indirect.</a>
			</ol>
		<li><a id="asr"></a>Eg. Age-standardized rates.
			<ul>
			<li>If age-specific mortality rates (<a class="c1">asmr</a>) for two or more populations are known, 
			use <a class="c1">direct</a> standardization.
			<li>If asmr are unknown, use indirect standardization.
			</ul>
		<li><a id="direct"></a><a class="c2">Direct</a> standardization steps:
			<ol class="ol2">
			<li>Calculate asmr (each age group, each population).
			<li>Choose one of the populations as reference (standard) population. 
			(*If the mortality rates of a specific community are compared to the national 
			population, then the national population is considered as reference).
			<li>Multiply asmr of population under study to the 
			number of persons in each age group of the standard population.
			<li>We'll get the expected deaths for each age group, each population.
			<li>Add the number of expected deaths from all age groups.
			<li>To get age-adjusted mortality rates, divide total number of expected
			deaths by the standard population.
			<li>Compare asmr of the two populations.
			</ol>
		<li><a id="directe"></a>Direct standardization, example:
			<img src="https://github.com/bazliamin90/img/blob/main/bios/0002a.png?raw=true">
			<ul class="ol2">
			<li>B have higher crude death rates (cdr) than A.
			<li>Next, use national population as reference.
			</ul>
			<img src="https://github.com/bazliamin90/img/blob/main/bios/0002b.png?raw=true">
			<ul class="ol2">
			<li>Expected death:
				<br>Population A : 1186.18
				<br>Population B : 1158.99
			<li>Age adjusted death rate:
				<br>A = (1186.18/51,000) x 1000 = 23.3 per 1000 population.
				<br>B = (1158.99/51,000) x 1000 = 22.7 per 1000 population.
			<li>Based on age-adjusted rates, risk of death is higher in population A than B.
			<li>Therefore, relying on crude death rates only is misleading.
			</ul>
		<li><a id="indirect"></a><a class="c1">Indirect</a> standardization steps:	
			<ol class="ol2">
			<li>Choose a reference population.
			<li>Calculate observed deaths in the populations of interest.
			<li>Apply asmr from reference population to the populations of interest. 
			<li>Multiply people in each age group of the populations, by the asmr in 
			the reference population.
			<li>Sum the total expected deaths for each population. 
			<li>Divide the total observed deaths, by 
			expected deaths.
			<li>The ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths is “Standardized mortality 
			ratio” (smr).
			<li>smr = od/ed
			<li>Calculate adjusted mortality rates (amr):
				<br>amr = smr x cdr
			<li>If asmr of the reference population is applied, cdr must be calculated 
			from that reference population.
			</ol>
		<li><a id="indirecte"></a>Indirect standardization, example:
			<ul class="ol2">
			<li>First, we must know the observed death:
				<br> A = 120
				<br> B = 30
			<li>Tabulate data.
			</ul>
			<img src="https://github.com/bazliamin90/img/blob/main/bios/0002z.png?raw=true">
			<ul class="ol2">
			<li>Calculate standardized mortality ratio (smr):
				<br>smr A = 120/195.5 = 0.61
				<br>smr B = 30/69.5 = 0.43
			<li>Still, risk of death is higher in population A than B, after adjusting for 
			differences by age. 
			<li>In indirect method, common practice is to compare smr.
			</ul>
