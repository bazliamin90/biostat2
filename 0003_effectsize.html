	<li>Magnitude of difference between groups.</li>

		<i>“You should describe the results in terms of measures of magnitude –not just, does a treatment affect people, but how much does it affect them.”</i>
			<br><br>-Gene V. Glass, on the importance of mentioning effect size.
	</li>
	
	<a id="prac" class="target"></a>
	<li>If statistical significance is denoted by p value, then practical significance (real world) is denoted by effect size.
		<ul>
			<li>P value = shows the existence of effect.
			<li>Effect size = shows the magnitude of effect.
		</ul>

	<a id="ss" class="target"></a>
	<li>Effect size is not affected by sample size. It estimates a population parameter. Whereby, p value is influenced by sample size as well as effect size.</li>
		<img src="https://github.com/bazliamin90/img/blob/main/bios/0003a.jpg?raw=true">
			<ul>
				<li>Effect size in the two studies is the same (r=0.30), although different N. Effect size is not influenced by sample size.</li>
				<li>But only in study with N=100 is statistically significant (CI does not cross 0).</li>
				<li>A population size of N=30 requires a value of r=0.35 to get p<0.05.</li>
				<li>This shows: p is influenced by sample & effect size.</li>
			</ul>
	<li>Effect size and sample size:
		<ul>
			<li>Large effect size = possible to be detected in small sample size.
			<li>Small effect size = requires large sample size.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<a id="eg" class="target"></a>
	<li>Example of study that shows importance of effect size:
		<ul>
			<li>Aspirin reduces risk of MI, P<.00001</li>
			<li>Therefore, it was statistically significant, and therefore recommended for prevention.</li>
			<li>However, <a class="c2">r2 = 0.001 → extremely small effect size</a>! {r2 = coefficient of determination, a type of effect size}</li>
			<li>As a result, many people took aspirin, although almost no benefit, while at risk of adverse effects.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Another example:
		<img src="https://github.com/bazliamin90/img/blob/main/bios/0003b.png?raw=true">
		<ul>
			<li>The result is statistically significant. That means there is a difference in effect between the methods.</li>
			<li>However, with an absolute difference of only 0.1 kg, is it really an effect? Can we just neglect it?</li>
			<li>Moreover, p-value does not even tell which one gives the slightly better mean weight loss.</li>
			<li>This is where calculating effect size (eg. using Cohen’s <i>d</i>) plays a role.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<a id="calc" class="target"></a>
	<li>Effect size is helpful to be calculated before and after data collection.
		<ul>
			<li>Before study:
				<ul>
					<li>Expected effect size can determine minimum sample size needed.</li>
					<li>Sample size affects power of study (likelihood of rejecting false null hypothesis/likelihood of detecting an effect when there is one).</li>
					<li>Do power analysis to determine minimum sample size.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>After study done:
				<ul>
					<li>Report the actual effect size in our result.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<a id="how" class="target"></a>
		<li>We can calculate effect size via Cohen’s d, Pearson’s r (correlation of coefficient), odds ratio, relative risk, and others.</li>
